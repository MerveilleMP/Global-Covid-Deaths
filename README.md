	# Global-Covid-Deaths
This contains SQL queries on global covid deaths. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data cleaning were the primary focus of this project.
Although I was completing a guided project, to further hone my SQL skills, I prioritized finding relevant information from the dataset or picked by curiosity. 
At the start of the project, there is some data cleaning and ensuring all the necessary information are present to find the instincts needed. And after that, Exploritory Data Analysis was the priority. There is so much more insights that could have been obtained from this dataset. Like always, there's always space for more findings!
